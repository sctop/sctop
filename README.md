## I'm Sctop.

I'm a senior high school student from Guangdong, China.

Currently a Blue Archive player as well (international server, TW region).

### Programming Skills

- Python [main language]
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript [only a little]
- C [only the very basic stuff]

### My likes

- Eating, sleeping
- Daydreaming without any practical work

- And, of course, the pursuit of the happy ending in every story.
